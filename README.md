Quarterly capsule planner + "Should I buy this?" AI decision assistant.

![CapsuleOS Demo](docs/demo.gif)
*Demo coming soon - placeholder for app screenshots*

## What it does

CapsuleOS helps you plan a cohesive quarterly capsule wardrobe and avoid low-value purchases by scoring items for:
- closet overlap
- price-per-wear
- review-derived fit/value signals

## MVP Features

- [x] Quarter setup (style keywords, budget, climate)
- [x] Capsule output (12-item capsule + palette + outfit formulas + product images)
- [x] "Should I Buy This?" scanner (Buy / Wait / Skip + pros/cons + alternatives)
- [ ] Review insights extractor (real fit/quality from reviews; currently rule-based)
- [x] Alternatives retrieval (same price range from DB)
- [x] Product images in capsule lookbook (Unsplash placeholders in seed data)

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind  
**Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
**Storage:** SQLite (DB initializes on server startup)  
**AI:** Heuristics + (optional) OpenAI; structured outputs for capsule/scanner

## Run locally

```bash
# backend (from backend/ with venv activated)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/seed_db.py   # optional: seed products + reviews
uvicorn main:app --reload

# frontend (from frontend/)
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Week 1: Product + Data
- [x] Week 2: Capsule generator v1
- [x] Week 3: Scanner v1 (UI + API, heuristic-based)
- [ ] Week 4: Review insights extractor (real ML/NLP)
- [x] Week 5: Ranking + alternatives (DB-backed alternatives)
- [ ] Week 6: Evaluation + polish + deploy

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** and go to the project directory.

2. **Backend setup:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env      # Add OPENAI_API_KEY if using LLM features
```

3. **Seed the database** (creates tables and sample products + reviews):
```bash
python scripts/seed_db.py
```

4. **Frontend setup:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

5. **Run:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend (initializes DB on startup)
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (Vite) or http://localhost:3000 — proxy forwards `/api` to backend:8000.

**Docker:** `docker-compose up` (see SETUP.md for details).

## How It Works

### Capsule Generation Logic (v1)

CapsuleOS generates personalized quarterly capsules through a multi-step process:

1. **Template Selection**: Based on quarter (Q1-Q4), selects a base template with recommended item categories and color palette
2. **Product Retrieval**: Queries database for products matching template categories, filtered by user's shopping preferences (brands)
3. **Item Selection**: For each category, selects:
   - **Best Value**: Product closest to 70% of per-item budget, prioritizing lower prices
   - **Best Quality**: Highest-priced product from premium brands (Aritzia, Everlane, etc.)
4. **Palette Extraction**: Extracts color palette from selected items, prioritizing most common colors
5. **Scoring & Ranking**: Computes capsule coherence scores:
   - **Palette Match**: How well items match the target color palette (0-1)
   - **Versatility**: Percentage of versatile items (tees, jeans, blazers) (0-1)
   - **Closet Overlap**: Penalty for duplicate categories in existing closet (0-1)
6. **Outfit Formulas**: Generates 3-4 outfit combinations from selected items
7. **Caching**: Results are cached for 1 hour to improve performance for similar requests

### Future Enhancements

- **Personalization**: ML-based item recommendations based on user style history
- **Closet Integration**: Real-time overlap detection with user's existing wardrobe
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Cost-per-wear optimization across the entire capsule
- **Style Matching**: Semantic similarity for style keyword matching

## What This Demonstrates

- ✅ **Full Stack**: React + Vite + FastAPI + SQLite
- ✅ **Ranking/Recommendation**: Best value / best quality picks, alternatives from DB
- ✅ **Caching**: TTL-based capsule response cache
- ✅ **Structured APIs**: Pydantic models, health check, capsule + analyze endpoints
- 🚧 **ML/NLP**: Review insights (baseline/rule-based; full pipeline planned)
- 🚧 **LLM**: Optional for pros/cons; prompts in place
- 📋 **Planned**: RAG, vector search, evaluation harness, production deploy

## Development Progress

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Project structure & setup
- [x] Database models & seeding
- [x] Capsule generator with real product data
- [x] Scoring logic (palette, versatility, overlap)
- [x] Caching layer (TTL-based)
- [x] Unit tests for scoring & caching
